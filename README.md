## Permissions

* `enderpearl.use` -- Allows player to use ender pearls.

## Configuration

The configuration is pretty simple and easy to figure out. 

`Enderpearl` -- the item you want to set as the ender pearl.

**This is the weapons name and not the projectile E.G**  `ak47u.entity`

I will make a list of weapon names for other items, in the mean time feel free to DM me on discord `WOLFLEADER#0999` if you would like a specific item ðŸ˜‰

```json
{
  "Enderpearl": "snowball.entity"
}
```
