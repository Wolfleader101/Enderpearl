* `enderpearl.use` -- Allows player to use ender pearls.

# Configuration

The configuration is pretty simple and easy to figure out. 
<hr>
`Enderpearl` is the item you want to set as the ender pearl.
**This is the weapons name and not the projectile E.G `ak47u.entity`**
<br>
I will make a list of weapon names for other items, in the mean time feel free to DM me on discord `WOLFLEADER#0999` if you would like a specific item 😉


```
{
  "Enderpearl": "snowball.entity"
