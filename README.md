# Permissions

* `enderpearl.use` -- Allows player to use ender pearls.

# Configuration

The configuration is pretty simple and easy to figure out. 
<hr>
First option `Enabled` is to enable or disable the plugin.
<br>
Second option `Enderpearl` is the item you want to set as the ender pearl.
**This is either the items shortname or ProjectilePrefab**
Some items such as 5.56 are prefab names and should be set it `riflebullet` <br>
For a list of item short names go to this [Item List](https://www.corrosionhour.com/rust-item-list/]). <br>
I will make a list of Projectile Prefab names for other items, in the mean time feel free to DM me on discord `WOLFLEADER#0999` if you would like a specific item 😉
